# Apples Shifting Game

This project demonstrates a simple interactive web application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, where apples can be transferred between two baskets using buttons.

---

## 📝 **Project Description**

The application consists of:
- **Two baskets**: One on the left and one on the right.
- **Two buttons**: "Move to Right" and "Move to Left".

### **How It Works:**
- Clicking the **"Move to Right"** button transfers apples from the left basket to the right basket.
- Clicking the **"Move to Left"** button transfers apples from the right basket to the left basket.
- The functionality is dynamically implemented using JavaScript to update the DOM.

## 🚀 **Features**

1. **Dynamic Apple Movement:** Apples are shifted between baskets without refreshing the page.
2. **Responsive Design:** The layout is styled using CSS to adapt to various screen sizes.
3. **Interactive Buttons:** The buttons trigger actions to demonstrate basic DOM manipulation.
